# Rise Desktop GUI
A desktop GUI for [Rise Selfbot](https://riseselfbot.xyz/).  
I will not be updating this frequently as i have other stuff to be working on.  
For those interested the GUI is made in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS using the GUI framework Electron.  

### How to use
> 1. Download and install node js.  
> 2. Run `npm install` in the same directory as the cloned repo.  
> 3. Once packages are installed run `npm run start` to start the app.  
> *FYI: I wont be releasing a compiled version.*

### Current state
> The current state of the GUI is functional and you can edit the config using the GUI.

### Features to come
> - Theme switcher, creator and removal
> - Script listing and removal
> - A file browser for set rise path
> - Viewer for rise console
